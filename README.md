## Notes on useRef hook
* The useRef hook creates a **reference** or `ref`
* A **reference** is a persisted, mutable object with a `current` property
* `references` can be used to:
  * Access the DOM directly
  * Store data outside of React's `state`

### IMPORTANT
* Changing a `ref` does not cause the component to re-render
* (but when we change a state value using `useState` the component will re-render)
