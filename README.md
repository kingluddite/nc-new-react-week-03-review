## Controlled forms
* Form state is in sync with the UI
* Able to respond to user input before the submission
* Can provide dynamic responses
* Can show or hide submit button
* Form data exists in state
* Can use separate stateful values for each input
* (or a single object with properties for each input - more common)

```
<form>
  <input value={inputValue}
</form>
```

* You will have two App.js (ControllAppOne.js and ControllAppTwo.js) - rename them to App.js to see how they work
* And AppFormik too
